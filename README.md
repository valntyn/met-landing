This is the landing page of The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
In the development of landing page, I used the following technologies of HTML and CSS:

1. HTML:
  - BEM Methodology
  - correct CODE STYLE
2. CSS:
  - Forms
  - Flexbox
  - Media queries
  - Grid
  - Transformations
3. in SSAS / SCSS preprocessor the following tools:
  - Functions
  - Nesting and &
  - loop @for
  - variables
  - @extend's and placeholders
  - Using @media in SCSS

Is is implemented using the mobile-first approach.
This is an adaptive landing page is designed to display content appropriately across all screen sizes, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobiles.
The landing page will adjust its layout, content, and images to provide an optimal user experience.
